Hear ye, fellow patriots of tea and biscuits! Are you ready to champion the cause of our beloved afternoon delights on the grand canvas of Reddit's /r/place? Behold, the ultimate guide to showcase our love and dedication for the crown jewels of British refreshments: the timeless tea and the beloved biscuit.

## Royal Scripts for a Royal Cause:

We present two regal scripts to assist you in this noble quest:

1. **Tea Auto-placer**: A sophisticated tool that embodies the spirit of a well-timed tea pour. It meticulously places the pixels, forming the portrait of our cherished tea mug on the canvas.
   
2. **Biscuit Template Overlay**: This is akin to the biscuit tin blueprint. It overlays an up-to-date template on your canvas, guiding you, the loyal biscuit brigade, to place pixels in honour of our crunchy comrades.

## Commandments for Using the Scripts:
